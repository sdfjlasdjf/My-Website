      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>1. Rental System (Apartments, Roommates, and Furniture)</h3>
        <p>
          I designed a rental system that allows users to post and find apartments, roommates,
          or secondhand furniture, and also chat directly with the owner. For this project, I used 
          <strong>Spring Boot</strong> as the main backend framework and <strong>Vue 3</strong> for the frontend. 
          <strong>Redis</strong> was utilized for user authorization and caching, while <strong>MySQL</strong> 
          served as the primary database. The system follows RESTful conventions for basic CRUD operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can either log in or register on the login page; upon registration, a token is generated, 
          stored in ThreadLocal and Redis, and then sent back to the frontend. 
        </p>

          <img src="EL1.jpg" alt="Login Page Placeholder">
        </div>
        <p>
          After logging in, a user selects a category (Finding a Place, Finding Roommates, or Secondhand Furniture), 
          enters a location, and sees all relevant posts. Clicking on a post opens its detail page, where the user 
          can “like” it or start a direct chat with the owner. Users can also create new posts by clicking on a 
          floating button in the bottom-left corner.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Mini Spring Writing</h3>
        <p>
          I am designing and implementing a lightweight Spring-like framework from scratch, replicating key features such as 
          **bean creation, initialization, and dependency injection**. This project involves developing custom annotations 
          like <strong>@ComponentScan</strong>, <strong>@Component</strong>, <strong>@Scope</strong>, and <strong>@Autowired</strong>, 
          enabling component discovery and injection. Additionally, I implemented a **BeanPostProcessor** to introduce custom 
          logic before and after bean initialization. The framework also integrates **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** to support 
          **method interception and cross-cutting concerns**, allowing for modularized and maintainable code. Currently, I am working 
          on enhancing Spring MVC by simplifying annotations for specific use cases, making development more streamlined.

      <!-- Project 2: Chat System -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>2. Chat System with Rich Features</h3>
        <p>
          I am building a chat system that allows users to send emojis, voice messages, and even transfer money.
          There is also a camera feature to send pictures directly. This project is still under active development, 
          and I'm continually adding new features.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Technologies used:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Go</strong> as the main programming language</li>
            <li><strong>Gin Framework</strong> for building RESTful APIs quickly</li>
            <li><strong>WebSocket</strong> for real-time communication</li>
            <li><strong>GORM</strong> for ORM and database interaction</li>
            <li><strong>Goroutines and Channels</strong> to handle concurrent tasks efficiently</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the core advantages of Go is its lightweight concurrency model using goroutines and channels. 
          This makes it easy to handle many simultaneous chat connections, ensuring responsive real-time messaging 
          even under heavy load.

      <!-- Project 3: Restaurant Suggestion System -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>3. Restaurant Suggestion System</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first major project and served as my senior design project at NYU (completed as a group). 
          The system recommends restaurants based on the user’s location and dish-style preferences, which are 
          identified through a simple chatbot. This chatbot is not powered by advanced AI; rather, it parses 
          user sentences and extracts key terms to find relevant dining options.
        </p>

          <img src="HAAK1.jpg" alt="Chatbot Conversation Placeholder">
        </div>
        <p>
          We also included a feature to send calendar notifications and email reminders about a selected restaurant. 
          This functionality was implemented using APIs for email sending and schedule management.
        </p>

          Overall, it was a challenging yet enlightening project that introduced me to user interaction design, 
          geolocation services, integrating external APIs, and implementing basic CRUD operations in a team setting.
