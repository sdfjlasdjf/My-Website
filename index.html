      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>1. Mini Spring Writing</h3>
        <p>
          I am designing and implementing a lightweight Spring-like framework from scratch, replicating key features such as 
          <strong>bean creation, initialization, and dependency injection</strong>. This project involves developing custom annotations 
          like <strong>@ComponentScan</strong>, <strong>@Component</strong>, <strong>@Scope</strong>, and <strong>@Autowired</strong>, 
          enabling component discovery and injection. Additionally, I implemented a <strong>BeanPostProcessor</strong> to introduce custom 
          logic before and after bean initialization. The framework also integrates <strong>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)</strong> to support 
          <strong>method interception and cross-cutting concerns</strong>, allowing for modularized and maintainable code. Currently, I am working 
          on enhancing Spring MVC by simplifying annotations for specific use cases, making development more streamlined.

      <!-- Project 2: Restaurant Suggestion System -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>2. Restaurant Suggestion System</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first major project and served as my senior design project at NYU (completed as a group). 
          The system recommends restaurants based on the user’s location and dish-style preferences, which are 
          identified through a simple chatbot. This chatbot is not powered by advanced AI; rather, it parses 
          user sentences and extracts key terms to find relevant dining options.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also included a feature to send calendar notifications and email reminders about a selected restaurant. 
          This functionality was implemented using APIs for email sending and schedule management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, it was a challenging yet enlightening project that introduced me to user interaction design, 
          geolocation services, integrating external APIs, and implementing basic CRUD operations in a team setting.
